			<p>A black policeman was killed and
70 were injured when a bomb was lobbed onto a parade ground in
South Africa&rsquo;s biggest black township of Soweto this morning,
the government said.</p>
<p>The device was thrown from a passing vehicle as trainee
township policemen from all over South Africa were on parade at
the Tladi police training centre, the government&rsquo;s Bureau for
Information said.</p>
<p>Ten officers were seriously wounded and 60 suffered slight
injuries, it said.</p>
<p>A bureau spokesman said the type of explosive device used
was not known and no arrests had been made.</p>
<p>The government has blamed a spate of limpet mine blasts in
South African cities in recent months on the outlawed African
National Congress (ANC), fighting a low-level guerrilla war
against white domination in South Africa.</p>
<p>The municipal police, who perform security duties in black
townships, have been a main target of black militants in the
past three years of political unrest which has claimed some
2,400 lives.</p>
<p>Many black policemen have been forced to live in compounds
on the outskirts of townships after their homes were attacked.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s attack, one of the most daring since a national
state of emergency was declared last June, came as police and
troops deployed at railway stations to stop attacks on trains
linked to a bitter strike by black transport workers.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Pik Botha has alleged that the ANC is
planning a campaign of violence in the run-up to the
whites-only general election next month. Security is a major
election issue, with extreme right-wingers accusing the
government of being soft in the face of a &ldquo;revolutionary
onslaught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Botha warned neighbouring black-ruled states not to allow
the guerrillas to infiltrate South Africa through their
territory. He said South Africa would not hesitate to take
action to thwart the alleged offensive.</p>
<p>Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana and Zimbabwe denied Botha&rsquo;s
charges and said they were a pretext for South African attacks
on them. Pretoria has raided alleged ANC bases in the so-called
Frontline states in the past.</p>
