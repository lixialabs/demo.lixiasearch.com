			<p>President Reagan said he hoped the
United States could lift trade sanctions against Japan soon.</p>
<p>But he said the United States would do what is necessary to
see that other nations lived up to their trade agreements.</p>
<p>In a speech prepared for delivery to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, he said, &ldquo;I hope that, before long, we can lift these
(Japanese trade sanctions) and that this episode will be
recorded as a small incident in the building of our
relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, Reagan added, &ldquo;we will do what is necessary to see that
other nations live up to their obligations and trading
agreements with us. Trade must be free. It must also be fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reagan said the decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300
mln dlrs worth of electronic exports to the United States sent
a message it was time to complete a U.S.-Japan &ldquo;trade bridge.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The final answer to the trade problems between America and
Japan is not more hemming and hawing, not more trade sanctions,
not more voluntary restraint agreements - though these may be
needed as steps along the way - and certainly not more
unfulfilled agreements,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Reagan said the answer was genuinely fair and open markets
on both sides of the Pacific - &ldquo;and the sooner, the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reagan said the administration&rsquo;s tools for dealing with
unfair trade practices met the need for both firmness and
finesse.</p>
<p>He said trade legislation pending in Congress would be
dangerous because it would force the administration to use &ldquo;a
steamroller against unfair practices every time, no matter
whether the steamroller would open the trade doors or flatten
the entire house,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Reagan said that ending every unfair trade practice in
Japan would cut the U.S. trade deficit by only about 10 pct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our trade deficit is to come down, more must be done &ndash;
and is being done,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The change in the dollar&rsquo;s value is part of it, and since
the middle of last year, the actual volume of our exports had
been on the rise,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He also said he believed America&rsquo;s trading partners should
cut taxes and regulations, as the United States had done, so
that they could create jobs and buy more goods.</p>
