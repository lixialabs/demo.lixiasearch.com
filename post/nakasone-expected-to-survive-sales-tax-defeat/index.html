			<p>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone&rsquo;s
unpopular sales tax plan has been defeated and although fellow
politicians and political analysts agree he has suffered a
grave loss of face only a few are willing to write him off.</p>
<p>Michio Watanabe, a Nakasone faction member and deputy
secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, LDP,
is one of those who believes he will survive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s tough, he won&rsquo;t step down,&rdquo; but &ldquo;will hang on to the
death&rdquo; at least until his term ends on October 30, Watanabe told
Reuters.</p>
<p>The sales tax scheme was a mainstay in Nakasone&rsquo;s plans to
revamp the nation&rsquo;s tax system for the first time in 36 years.
Watanabe acknowledged that the five pct sales tax was a
mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too greedy,&rdquo; he said. A two or three pct tariff might
have been easier to swallow, he said.</p>
<p>One popular school of thought among skeptical analysts is
that Nakasone will be remain in office at least until the June
8-10 summit of industrialised nations in Venice.</p>
<p>A Western diplomatic observer said he believed that
Nakasone would be at the summit as prime minister. But he would
not bet on his chances of survival up until October.</p>
<p>Masamichi Inoki, a senior fellow at the conservative
Institute of Peace and Security, said he did not think Nakasone
had suffered irreparable damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will certainly hang on for the summit,&rdquo; Inoki said.</p>
<p>In any event, the general belief now is that the five pct
sales tax, as championed by Nakasone, is a dead issue but that
an indirect tax, in another form, will be introduced by the
LDP.</p>
<p>Inoki said he believed the issue would be resurrected as
early as the next Diet (parliament) meets. The current session
finishes on May 27.</p>
<p>The newspaper Tokyo Shimbun expressed another stream of
opinion, stating that Nakasone might well get another year to
deal with the unfinished and unpopular business of tax reform.</p>
<p>The government has to find a way of generating revenue to
support an expected glut of elderly Japanese.</p>
<p>And the only means of drumming up the money is to levy an
indirect tax, said Watanabe, a former Minister of International
Trade and Industry.</p>
<p>The next prime minister will have to grapple with an
indirect tax, and &ldquo;whoever is the next prime minister won&rsquo;t be
in the job very long,&rdquo; Watanabe said.</p>
<p>Watanabe said he doubted the next prime minister would be
any of the three so-called &ldquo;New Leaders,&rdquo; LDP secretary general
Noboru Takeshita, LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe,
and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Each of them controls a
powerful LDP faction. &ldquo;It will be somebody else,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Political science professor Rei Shiratori of Dokkyo
University gave one of the darkest readings on Nakasone&rsquo;s
political future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after the Venice summit, there will be a move to
change the government by the New Leaders,&rdquo; Shiratori said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t fight on,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He said Nakasone had a special emotional attachment to the
sales tax plan as the last and most important item in Japan&rsquo;s
purge of policies inherited from the U.S. Occupation.</p>
<p>Shiratori said an indirect tax will have to be levied, but
&ldquo;to introduce such a tax, they&rsquo;ll have to change the prime
minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Shiratori said he believes Nakasone could
hang on until as late as September.</p>
