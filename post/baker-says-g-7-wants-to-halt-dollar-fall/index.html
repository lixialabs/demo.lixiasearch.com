			<p>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations is fully
committed to halting a further decline in the dollar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me emphasize that all seven major industrial nations
remain fully committed to strengthening policy coordination,
promoting growth and cooperating to foster stability of
exchange rates,&rdquo; he told the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be
counter productive to our efforts (to promote growth),&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Baker also said that after meeting Japanese special envy
Shintaro Abe, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s clear that Japan intends to take strong
steps to stimulate its economy to meet its committments under
the Louvre Accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baker said in the past two years he has worked to promote
greater coordination of economic policies and important
progress has been made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Substantial exchange rate adjustments have also been
accomplished over the past two years so that today we are
better positioned to promote growth and reduce external
imbalances,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Baker pointed out that in February the seven agreed to
foster stable exchange rates and those commitments were
renewed recently.</p>
<p>In a speech largely devoted to discussing trade and
competitiveness, Baker again warned of the dangers of
protectionist trade legislation, saying it would harm the U.S.
standard of living.</p>
<p>Baker stressed adminstration trade policy sought to remove
foreign barriers to trade and via forthcoming GATT talks will
focus on agriculture, services and intellectual property.</p>
<p>The Treasury Secretary said that as well as trade issues he
had to focus on macroeconomic issues as well which encompass
the trade picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world economy today is really one constantly flowing
circle of capital and goods. Trade accounts catch and measure
that flow at only one spot on the circle,&rdquo; he said.</p>
