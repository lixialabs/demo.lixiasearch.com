			<p>China is likely to borrow up to
300 mln dlrs this year from the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
president Masao Fujioka said.</p>
<p>The loans would be China&rsquo;s first from the ADB.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there will be at least one loan to China this year,
and possibly a second,&rdquo; Fujioka told a news conference at the
end of the ADB&rsquo;s annual meeting here.</p>
<p>Asked how large the loans were likely to be, Fujioka said
he thought they would range from 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs each.</p>
<p>China is the ADB&rsquo;s newest member, joining in March 1986.</p>
<p>China is the third-largest shareholder after Japan and the
U.S.. It was elected to the ADB&rsquo;s 12-member board yesterday.</p>
<p>Fujioka announced that the ADB&rsquo;s 1989 meeting would be held
in Peking. The 1988 meeting will be held in Manila.</p>
<p>Fujioka said the ADB would consider delegates&rsquo; suggestions
that it set up a task force of experts to define its future
role. The ADB&rsquo;s performance was criticised by both its rich and
poor members at the three-day meeting just finished.</p>
<p>External experts had carried out a study on ADB policy for
the 1980s, Fujioka said. He said a similar study for the 1990s
would be useful, but the ADB had no fixed ideas yet.</p>
<p>He said the ADB had already responded to members like the
U.S., Which urged it to improve analysis of funded projects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had already decided that the ADB should strengthen its
research capability,&rdquo; Fujioka said.</p>
<p>He said ADB lending had declined, but &ldquo;the amount is not the
only thing that counts. We also want to be a catalyst by taking
innovative measures like the promotion of the private sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fujioka also talked of the struggle between the U.S. And
Japan over their voting power in the ADB.</p>
<p>Total Japanese contributions to the ADB are higher than
those of the U.S., So Japanese delegates asked for their voting
power to reflect this. The U.S. Opposed the move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is advisable and wise, for institutions like the ADB to
be viable, that there be a reasonable relationship between
financial contributions and voting power,&rdquo; Fujioka said.</p>
<p>But he indicated the problem remained unresolved.</p>
<p>Asked if the ADB would respond to a plea by Vietnam to
resume lending which was cut off in 1974, Fujioka re-iterated
his view that conditions there were not conducive to banking.</p>
<p>Fujioka declined to elaborate on Vietnam, but said there
had been no pressure from the U.S. Or any other country on the
issue.</p>
<p>He also spoke about demands by the bank&rsquo;s financiers that
it take a more active role in prodding borrowers into making
economic policy changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The initiative must come from the borrowing country. We
don&rsquo;t accept that we impose policy conditions. There must be a
two-way consultation,&rdquo; he said.</p>
