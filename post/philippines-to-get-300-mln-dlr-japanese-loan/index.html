			<p>The Philippines has received a 300
mln dlr loan from the Japanese Export-Import Bank, Philippine
Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ongpin said the loan, carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year,
matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the
World Bank in March.</p>
<p>Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the
Philippines&rsquo; 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting
here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan&rsquo;s Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed.</p>
<p>Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to
a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and
80 billion yen.</p>
<p>The aid package, originally scheduled for Japan&rsquo;s 1986/87
fiscal year ended March, was delayed because of the
Philippines&rsquo; change of government last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we
are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49
billion yen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But they are likely to bring it up to
that level for the 15th package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the
14th yen package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of
untied commodity loans,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft
loans to finance a land reform program, for which Japan is
expected to supply most of the financing, had been put off
until next month because of delays in preparatory work.</p>
<p>Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform
program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here.</p>
<p>Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB&rsquo;s
support after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposed
leader Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would like to see them push more aggressively in the
field of lending to the private sector,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Philippines was the bank&rsquo;s second-biggest borrower
after Pakistan in 1986, with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs.</p>
<p>Ongpin said he expects ADB lending to the Philippines in
1987 to reach the same level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have told us they can lend us two billion dlrs if we
want. But we have to come up with the projects,&rdquo; he said.</p>
