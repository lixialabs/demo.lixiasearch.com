The other danger was that money supply expansion could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its central bank being involved in the activity.</description>

Taiwan would have a surplus for export of about 100,000 tonnes in 1988, he said.</description>

      <description>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference the basic solution to currency instability among major nations is economic policy coordination.&#xA;He said that is a time-consuming process as coordination does not always proceed in a way policy makers envisage. &amp;ldquo;That is democracy,&amp;rdquo; he said. Upon that foundation, Miyazawa said, there must be coordinated intervention. Major nations have sufficient funds to continue concerted intervention, he added.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Without doubt this set-up of coordinated intervention will continue to operate,&amp;rdquo; Miyazawa said.</description>

It did not specify what levels it considered normal.&#xA;West Germany posted a record trade surplus of 124 billion marks in 1986, after 86 billion in 1985 and its current account surplus widened to 76.</description>

      <description>The most likely reason for West German producers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores is that they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtaining European Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said.&#xA;They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brussels saying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250 tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1.&#xA;The traders said it is also likely that French producers, who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw a significant proportion of this for the same reason before they are due to accept payment for the sugar in early May.</description>
