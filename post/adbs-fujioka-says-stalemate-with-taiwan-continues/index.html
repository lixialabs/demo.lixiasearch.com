			<p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will
not change its decision to admit China as a member despite
protests from founder member Taiwan, bank president Masao
Fujioka said.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s admission in March 1986 and the decision of the
bank to change Taiwan&rsquo;s name to &lsquo;Taipei, China&rsquo; caused a
Taiwanese boycott of the ADB&rsquo;s last annual meeting in Manila.</p>
<p>Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had been
invited to the bank&rsquo;s 20th annual meeting starting April 27 in
Osaka, &ldquo;but the situation remains the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank&rsquo;s board agreed to change Taiwan&rsquo;s name to &lsquo;Taipei,
China&rsquo;,&rdquo; Fujioka said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have tried to maintain our channels of communication
through the Taiwanese director, but we are not negotiating with
a view to changing our agreement with China,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding among
the bank&rsquo;s developing members, with 7.2 pct of its equity.</p>
<p>Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam, which
complained at last year&rsquo;s meeting that for several years the
ADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans.</p>
<p>An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs was
made to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974.</p>
<p>Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loan
were disbursed.</p>
<p>The bank&rsquo;s 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved for
Vietnam, eight had been closed, two were suspended and only one
was under administration at the end of 1986.</p>
<p>Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986
totalled 25.3 mln dlrs, or 99.5 pct of the total amount of
effective loans, the report said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bank
operations,&rdquo; Fujioka said. &ldquo;Vietnam continues to be a member. We
would like to help it, but new loans seem to be difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of political instability, the
environment has to be right for banking operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said with the first loans made to India in 1986, and
lending operations in China scheduled to start this year, the
ADB had now acquired a &ldquo;truly Asian&rdquo; character.</p>
<p>Although China&rsquo;s finance ministry had gained five years of
experience in borrowing from the World Bank, ADB loans would be
routed through the country&rsquo;s central bank, Fujioka said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a very slow start,&rdquo; Fujioka said. &ldquo;We identified
three projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have only
two left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mln
dlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project.</p>
<p>He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India.</p>
<p>The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250
mln dlrs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India should
be modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender,&rdquo;
Fujioka said. He did not give details.</p>
