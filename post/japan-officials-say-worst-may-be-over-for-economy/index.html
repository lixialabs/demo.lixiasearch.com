			<p>Government officials said the worst may be
over for the Japanese economy, after today&rsquo;s news of stronger
than expected growth in the January/March period.</p>
<p>But private economists were not so sure and said the
economy was unlikely to achieve the government&rsquo;s 3.5 pct growth
forecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.</p>
<p>As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/March
quarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three
months. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNP
growth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.</p>
<p>The government economists acknowledged that the improved
export performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to
be repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up two
pct from the previous three months.</p>
<p>The yen&rsquo;s rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150
probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June
quarter, they said.</p>
<p>However, given the yen&rsquo;s recent stability, stepped-up
domestic demand should work as a driving force to push the
economy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.</p>
<p>Many private economists, though, doubt that the economy
will achieve the government&rsquo;s 3.5 pct growth forecast for the
1987/88 year.</p>
<p>Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government&rsquo;s
forecast, which was revised downwards to three pct last
December from an original four pct.</p>
<p>Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except for
housing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi
Research Institute.</p>
<p>Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in
nominal income stays low, he added.</p>
<p>The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter
was simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the
preceding three months, Takahashi said.</p>
<p>Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but
this was primarily because utility companies brought forward
their 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter
of 1986/87 in line with the government&rsquo;s economic stimulation
package announced last fall, he said.</p>
<p>Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he
was unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added he
expects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.</p>
<p>Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting
to rebuild inventories, Furuta said.</p>
<p>Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lower
interest rates as well as government policies to stimulate the
sector, he said. The government&rsquo;s recently unveiled 6,000
billion yen economic package will also help the economy.</p>
<p>But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve the
government&rsquo;s 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growth
might come close to three pct.</p>
