			<p>The resignation of Finance Minister
Dilson Funaro is bound to focus attention on whether Brazil
will now adopt a more flexible debt stance and move towards an
accord with creditors, bankers and political analysts said.</p>
<p>With Funaro in charge, Brazil&rsquo;s relations with creditors
sank to a low ebb, they said.</p>
<p>Bankers told anti-Funaro jokes from Sao Paulo to New York
and economic analysts said the personal animosity between the
minister and U.S. Bankers was a real obstacle to reaching
agreement on rescheduling Brazil&rsquo;s 111 billion dlr debt.</p>
<p>Commenting on Funaro, a foreign banker here recently told
Reuters, &ldquo;They (banks) see his removal pretty much as a
precondition for getting serious negotiations under way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Funaro angered the banks in February by suspending interest
payment on Brazil&rsquo;s 68 billion dlr bank debt.</p>
<p>There was also a question of personal style. Bankers
disliked Funaro&rsquo;s aloof demeanor and in private heatedly
accused him of arrogance and inflexibility.</p>
<p>However, Funaro did not fall because he upset foreign
bankers but rather because his Cruzado Plan price freeze last
year was a massive flop, economically and politically.</p>
<p>However, it is in the domain of the debt and Brazil&rsquo;s
relation with creditors that his departure will have the most
closely-watched international repercussion, bankers said.</p>
<p>It became part of Funaro&rsquo;s trademark that he would have no
truck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus
effectively blocking a debt agreement.</p>
<p>He argued that if Brazil sought the help of the IMF, the
Fund would lay down conditions which would lead to recession.</p>
<p>Funaro and others who supported this position had memories
of the IMF austerity program in Brazil in the early 1980s, a
period when hungry crowds stormed supermarkets.</p>
<p>The foreign banker in Sao Paulo said, &ldquo;I think Brazil could
have an agreement with the IMF which would allow (it)
acceptable growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argentina, working with the IMF, won excellent terms for a
major portion of its 50 billion dlr debt earlier this month.</p>
<p>Given the IMF role in the Argentine accord, a U.S. Diplomat
here said the agreement had been extremely damaging for Funaro
because it showed that cooperation with the IMF bore fruit.</p>
<p>Mexico has also taken the IMF path and, earlier than
Argentina, clinched a favourable pioneering agreement with
creditors on its 100 billion dlr debt.</p>
<p>Brazil is now the only one of the three biggest Latin
American debtors not to have a debt agreement.</p>
<p>Some Brazilian opinion, particularly in the business
community, is favourable to an IMF accord.</p>
<p>A leading newspaper, Jornal do Brazil, carried a report
from Washington over the weekend saying it was a myth the IMF
brought recession and the best moment for an accord was now. As
it happens, a routine IMF mission is visiting Brasilia.</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly dismissed speculation it is
considering any major change in debt policy and political
analysts caution against expecting changes on the IMF issue.</p>
<p>The government of President Jose Sarney has gained a
reputation for chronic indecisiveness and some analysts believe
the government will turn to the IMF only if it comes to the
conclusion there really is no option.</p>
<p>But such a policy shift looks more and more likely before
too long in the eyes of many analysts.</p>
<p>One major political obstacle, Funaro, is no longer in the
picture and the economic pressures on Brazil are growing.</p>
<p>The sharp drop in the trade surplus, which triggered
Brazil&rsquo;s present debt crisis, shows no sign of being reversed.
In the first quarter of 1987 Brazil chalked up a surplus of
only 526 mln dlrs, just a fraction of the 2.47 billion dlr
surplus it had in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Brazilian officials concede that time is not on their side
in the debt crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brazil has an interest in resolving this problem as rapidly
as possible,&rdquo; Central Bank President Francisco Gros said on
Friday.</p>
