			<p>The U.K. Economy looks stronger than it
did only last month, when the government unveiled its budget
for fiscal 1987/88, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said.</p>
<p>He told Parliament that &ldquo;all the indicators that have been
published since the budget confirm that, if anything, we are
doing even better than I suggested then.&rdquo; The budget was
unveiled on March 17.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come out
lower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lower
than I suggested &hellip; (and) the current account of the balance
of payments is also performing better, so far, than I
predicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the end
of this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said at
the time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0
billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg.</p>
<p>He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987
of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said &ldquo;output
appears to be rising, if anything, rather faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, &ldquo;by the
end of this year we will have registered the longest period of
steady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the British
economy has known since the (Second World) War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basic
rate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound.</p>
<p>Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed to
further cut the standard rate to &ldquo;no more than 25p.&rdquo; He said that
that objective &ldquo;should not take too long to achieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to policies proposed by political opposition
parties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party would
entail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg.</p>
<p>That, he said, &ldquo;would require either a doubling of the basic
rates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of
(valued added tax) VAT,&rdquo; which is currently 15 pct.</p>
<p>On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservative
government promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determined
in the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and no
responsible government could conceivably take any other
position,&rdquo; he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives of
planning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods.</p>
<p>Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxation
can often produce higher, not lower, revenues  &ldquo;thus leading to
the scope for still further reductions in taxation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawson said &ldquo;inheritance tax is expected this year to yield
almost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax did
in 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80
pct higher in real terms, and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that &ldquo;the greatly increased yield of Corporation
Tax, reflecting greatly increased company profitability, is
clearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation I
introduced in 1984, which brought the rate of tax on company
profits in this country to the lowest in the industrialised
world.&rdquo;</p>
