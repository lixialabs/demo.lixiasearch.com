			<p>Japan is faced with a mounting crisis
over its huge trade surplus and recognizes that it must act
more quickly to refocus its export driven economy, a senior
Foreign Ministry official said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sense of crisis among the Japanese public as well as
the government is increasing,&rdquo; Deputy Director General Hiroshi
Hirabayashi told reporters. &ldquo;The need to accelerate the efforts
(to restructure the economy) is well recognized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hirabayashi said that gradual progress had been made to
refocus the Japanese economy, but admitted that it might not
seem all that spectacular to foreign observers.</p>
<p>Difficulties had been encountered in implementing the
so-called Maekawa report since it was unveiled a year ago, he
said. But, he added, foreign governments should appreciate the
efforts that have been made.</p>
<p>The report, named for its principal author, former Bank of
Japan governor Haruo Maekawa, called for a shift in Japan&rsquo;s
economy away from its dependence on exports for growth. The
Japanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since its
release.</p>
<p>According to Hirabayashi, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
told his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the direction
set out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieve
it.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough had
been done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocus
its economy.</p>
<p>Listing some of those actions, Hirabayashi said imports of
manufactured goods have increased, interest rates have fallen,
and coal, steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced.</p>
<p>He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in the
future to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion that
it would take ten years for Maekawa&rsquo;s goals to be met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not take very much time to fulfill the (goals) set
out by the Maekawa report,&rdquo; he said.</p>
